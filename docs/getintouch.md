# Get in Touch

If you have any ideas for ways to improve our existing codebase, feel free to open an Issue Request (found here: [Open New Issue](https://github.com/CDCgov/tostadas/issues/new/choose))

## Steps to Open Issue Request:
### (1) Select Appropriate Template
Following the link above, there are four options for issue templates and your selection will depend on (1) if you are a user vs maintainer/collaborator and (2) if the request pertains to a bug vs feature enhancement. Please select the template that accurately reflects your situation.

### (2) Fill Out Necessary Information
Once the appropriate template has been selected, you must fill/answer all fields/questions specified. The information provided will be valuable in getting more information about the issue and any necessary context surrounding it.

### (3) Submit the Issue
Once all information has been provided, you may now submit it!

Please allow for some turnaround time for us to review the issue and potentially start addressing it. If this is an urgent request and have not heard from us nor see any progress being made after quite some time (longer than a week), feel free to start a discussion (found here: Start New Discussion) mentioning the following:

* Issue Number
* Date Submitted
* General Background on Bug/Feature
* Reason for Urgency
And we will get back to you as soon as possible.
