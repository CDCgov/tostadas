## PATHOGEN ANNOTATION AND SUBMISSION PIPELINE
  
A portable, open-source pipeline designed to streamline submission of pathogen genomic data to public repositories.  Reducing barriers to timely data submission increases the value of public repositories for both public health decision making and scientific research. TOSTADAS facilitates routine sequence submission by standardizing and automating: 

+ Metadata Validation   
+ Genome Annotation    
+ File submission    

TOSTADAS is designed to be flexible, modular, and pathogen agnostic, allowing users to customize their submission of raw read data, assembled genomes, or both. The current release has been tested with sequence data from Poxviruses and select bacteria. Testing for additional pathogen is planned for future releases.
